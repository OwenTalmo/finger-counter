# FINGER-COUNTER

Some python code to count the number of fingers being held up in a live video recorded on the webcam using mediapipe. 
Currently opens webcam, runs mediapipe hand landmark detection, overlays landmarks on the hand, and calculates the number of fingers raised, and displays that on the screen. 
Still a work in progress, the "finger raised" criteria means that thumb is almost always classified as raised! Going to fix that next.
