# FINGER-COUNTER

Some python code to count the number of fingers being held up in a live video recorded on the webcam using mediapipe. 
Currently opens webcam and runs mediapipe hand landmark detection on the video stream. Still a work in progress, next step is to visualize the results! Then from there we'll determine which fingers are raised and count them.
