# FINGER-COUNTER

Some python code to count the number of fingers being held up in a live video recorded on the webcam using mediapipe. 
Currently opens webcam and runs mediapipe hand landmark detection and displays results on the screen. 
Still a work in progress, next step is to determine which fingers are raised and count them!
